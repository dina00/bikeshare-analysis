# Explore US Bikeshare Data :bike:

## Overview
A script to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. This works by importing the data and answering interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. In addition to an interactive experience where the user is asked which data to analyze.

## About the data
The data is provided by Motivate, which is a bike share system provider for many cities in the United States. The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:

-   Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
-   End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
-   Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
-   Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
-   End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
-   User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

-   Gender
-   Birth Year
## How to run the script
- In you code editor's terminal run the following:
1. Install pandas and numpy through `pip install pandas` and `pip install numpy`.
2. Navigate into the project's directory.
3.  Run the project `python bikeshare.py`.
